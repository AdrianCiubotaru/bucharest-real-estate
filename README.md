# Machine Learning Engineer - Capstone Project
Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program - Predicting real estate prices in Bucharest

## Object
The project proposal is to build a predictor model that recieves, as input, apartment information, guesses the price of this apartment and return it as a HTTP response. As an experiment, supervised machine learning algorithms will be used to build and improve the model. To go further and receive theses apartment information, an endpoint will be developed using Lambda Functions and API Gateway.

The main idea of this project is to put into practice all the machine learning and software engineer knowledge learned during the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program and join it into my developed skills as a Software Developer.


## Endpoint
- [Netlify app](https://quizzical-brattain-4ffddb.netlify.app/)
- [Repository for front-end](https://github.com/AdrianCiubotaru/real-estate-front-end)
